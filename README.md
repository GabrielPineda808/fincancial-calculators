# fincancial-calculators

Welcome to my Financial Calculator CLI Java App!

This app was created to be used by a financial organization to be able provide a set of financial calculators for their clients.

The fincancial calculator app provides access to three accurate calculators that include a Mortgage Calculator, the future value of a CD,
and the present value of an Ordinary Annuity.

This app was coded using Java. 

Below are a few examples of how the app functions along with some of my favorite aspects of it.

I hope you enjoy the app as much as I did.
